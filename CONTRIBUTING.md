* Indentation
    * Use 4 spaces for indentations, do not use 2 spaces  
    * Do NOT use tabs
    
* Vertical whitespace
    * Place a blank line before the first member of a class, interface, enum, etc. (i.e. after class Example {) as well 
    as after the last member
    
* File headers
    * File headers must contain the license headers for the project.

* Javadocs
    * Do not use @author
    * Wrap additional paragraphs in `<p>` and `</p>`
    * Capitalize the first letter in the descriptions within each “at clause”, i.e. @param name Player to affect, no
      periods
